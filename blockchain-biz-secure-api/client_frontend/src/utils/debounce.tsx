/**
 * Returns `fn` wrapped by a function that delays invoking `fn` for `delay`
 * milliseconds since the last call. Set `options.leading` to invoke `fn` on
 * the leading edge of the delay, and/or set `options.trailing` to invoke `fn`
 * on the trailing edge of the delay (true by default).
 *
 * Example for `debounce(fn, 30, {leading: true, trailing: true})`,
 * where `fn` is called twice, with the second call made 20 ms after the first:
 *
 * Time:     0                   20                            50 (ms)
 * Timeline: |----------------------------------------------------------------|
 *           ^                   ^                             ^
 *           |                   |                             |
 *           | First call.       | Second call 20ms after the  | End of delay.
 *           | (instant leading  | first.                      | (trailing edge
 *           |  edge call)       |                             |  call)
 *                               |-----------------------------|
 *                               |  30 ms delay for debounce.  |
 *
 *
 * Note that if both `options.leading` and `options.trailing` are true, `fn`
 * will only be invoked on the trailing edge if the debounced function is called
 * more than once during the delay.
 *
 * @param fn - Function to debounce.
 * @param delay - Milliseconds to delay calling `fn` since the last call.
 * @param options - See `DebounceOptions` and `defaultDebounceOptions`.
 * @returns A debounced `fn`.
